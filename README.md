#driver for ili9341 display and touch on stm32f3discovery

used code from [eziya's repo](https://github.com/eziya/STM32_HAL_ILI9341/) and [martnak's repo](https://github.com/martnak/STM32-ILI9341/)

check the .h files for the pin outs but it uses all of them except for miso (on the microcontroller).
